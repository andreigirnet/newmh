            <h2>Is a Manual Handling Refresher Legally Required?</h2>
            <p>Under workplace safety legislation, training is not a "once-off" event. Standard guidelines suggest that **Manual Handling Training Ireland** should be refreshed at least every three years, or sooner if workplace tasks change significantly.</p>

            <p>A **Manual Handling Refresher** ensures that employees maintain a high level of competency and are aware of any updates to general safety regulations. Our **Manual Handling Online** refresher course provides a focused review of safe lifting principles, dynamic risk assessment, and the latest ergonomic best practices.</p>
