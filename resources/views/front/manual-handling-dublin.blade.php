            <h2>Protecting the Dublin Workforce: Spinal Biomechanics</h2>
            <p>A core element of our **Manual Handling Training Dublin** is the scientific study of the spine. The human back is highly vulnerable to compression forces when lifting loads away from the center of gravity. Incorrect lifting techniques can lead to long-term Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), which account for over 30% of workplace injuries in the Dublin region.</p>



            <p>Our training focuses on the **8 Principles of Safe Lifting**, including maintaining a neutral spine and utilizing the powerful muscles of the legs. By visualizing these biomechanical forces through our HD video modules, learners gain a practical understanding of how to protect their health while meeting **manual handling compliance Dublin** standards.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Risk Assessment (TILE)</h3>
            <p>Before any physical movement occurs, we train Dublin workers to perform a TILE risk assessment:</p>

            <ul class="mh-feature-list">
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Analyzing if the lift involves twisting or stooping.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual:</strong> Assessing the worker's physical capacity and training history.</li>
                <li><strong>Load:</strong> Identifying if the object is bulky, sharp, or unstable.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Checking for slippery floors or restrictive spaces.</li>
            </ul>
